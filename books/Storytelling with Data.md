# Takeaways
## Introduction
-  Many folks create bad graphs because they disconnect the narrative from the visualization.
-  Author learned how important combining narrative w/ visuals is with her work on Google's People Analytics team
### Six guidelines for making better visuals
1.   Context is important
2.   Choose an appropriate visual display
3.   Eliminate clutter
4.   Focus attention where you want it
5.   Think like a designer
6.   Tell a story
## Chapter 1: importance of context
- When presenting to your audience, you should display results of your explanatory analysis, not your exploratory analysis.
- To improve your explanatory analysis presentation, consider the following question:
	-  To whom are you communicating?
		- the audience and your relationship with them
	-  What do you want your audience to know or do?
		- consider the action, mechanism, and tone
- How can you use data to help make your point?
- what data is available to help you make your point

 **Share your idea + a 3-minute story.**
-  Try using post-it notes to layout your logical progression to help you understand the story you are telling.
## Chapter 2: choosing and effective visual
- Chapter explores the 12 visual the author most commonly uses in her presentation.
- There is no magic answer for the "right visual". Chapter goes into greater detail on formatting particular visualization types for better results.
- The visual should tie directly back to your contextual question "What do I want my audience to know or do?"
- Outside of this booked, here is the great guide for choosing a visual

## Chapter 3: clutter is your enemy
- Every element you add to your report creates cognitive load for your audience
- Is the visual adding enough informative value given the context you established for your story. If not, remove the element/visual.
- Within each visual, you want to avoid clutter because it will overwhelm your audience and make the visual seem more complex than it needs to be.
### Consider Principles of Visual Perception
1. **Proximity**: things closer together are more related
2. **Similarity**: group objects based on size, color, shape and orientation
3. **Enclosure**: group objects that enclosed together
4. **Closure**: our brains fill in the gaps when elements are missing, avoid overuse of borders
5. **Continuity**: similar to enclosure, we will complete shapes & patterns in our minds when not explicit
6. **Connection**: we assume relationship when drawing a line between objects (connect the dots)
- When clutter is thoughtfully removed, the audience doesn't notice. Conversely, they will notice when clutter is present because they will feel the cognitive load.
**Get more comfortable with the use of white space**
## Chapter 4: focus your audience's attention
### Preattentive Attributes
- (size, color and position) can be used to:
	- Direct attention where you intend to have it
	- Create visual hierarchy to lead audience focus through the information you intend to communicate
### Types of Memory
- **Iconic**: extremely fast memory that initially assesses an environment for threats / triggers
- **Short-term**: memory that is used consciously and then converts to long-term or is forgotten
- **Long-term**: memory that is stored and used for pattern recognition
### Demonstration

> _Iconic memory enables the audience to see what we want them to see before they are conscious of seeing it._
### Visual Types of [[Preattentive Attributes]]
- Orientation
- Shape
- Line length
- Line width
- Size
- Curvature
- Added marks
- Enclosure
- Hue
- Intensity
- Spatial position
- Motion
> **NOTE**: Use [[Preattentive Attributes]] sparingly to enhance their capabilities
## Chapter 5: think like a designer
### Affordances
- Highlight what's important using preattentive attributes
- Eliminate distraction because not all data is equally important
- Create a clear visual hierarchy of information to signal how the audience to process what is displayed
### Accessibility
- Do not overcomplicate with data points, legends, or language
- Use text to help audience interpret information how you intend it to be interpreted
### Aesthetics
- Be smart with color to highlight importance
- Pay attention to alignment to establish unity and cohesion with the information
- Leverage white space to limit complexity and increase the power of preattentive attributes
### Audience Acceptance
- Articulate the benefits of the new approach through transparency to help audience become comfortable with the why behind the new visual
- Show a side-by-side if necessary between the old and new approach to help audience understand what is superior about the new visualization
- Provide multiple options and seek input to determine the best visual for the audience. Remember…it's for them, not just you.
- Recruit a vocal member of your audience to help promote the visual for others and increase the chances of adoption.
