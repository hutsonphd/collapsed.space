# Takeways
## Ch. 1: Weapons of Influence
"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler" -Al Einstein
### Summary
The chapter operates through using story comparing animal research to attempt parallels to human behavior and decisions. All animals, and people, has some form of automatic response to stimuli. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce possible ways to trigger automatic responses in human behavior.
### Key Points
- When asking someone to do a favor, you are more successful when providing a reason
- "expense = good" translate to "betting the odds" when a person is making a decision
    - price, however, is not the only trigger for assumed quality
- People need **shortcuts** to deal with overwhelming stimulus
- People are more likely to by complementary items after they buy the foundational item
- Perspective is a powerful tool when framing news (good or bad)
## Ch 2: Reciprocation
"Pay every debt, as if God wrote the bill" - Ralph Waldo Emerson
### Summary
This chapter is focused on the rule of reciprocation. This rule is a fundamental behavior shared by every society human. When we receive a gift/favor, we find we are primed / obligated to say "yes" when another favor is asked. Given this rule is true, then it is to the advantage of the influencer to provide a "no strings" gift to elicit future compliance. Avoid being influenced by the rule throughly truly treating the gift as no stings.
### Key Points
- Rule of Reciprocation: every human society subscribes owing a debt for something received
- The rule of reciprocity over comes other factors that normally effects our decision to comply. (i.e. the extent to which someone likes you
- Never accept the return of a gift, no matter if the person refuses
- Obligation to receive can start or open exploitation given the obligation to repay
- Unfair exchanges can harm reciprocation
- Favors should be met with favors, not tricks met with with favors. If you receive a favor given for the purpose of influencing/manipulating you (aka trick), then call it out to the giver of the trick. However, assume you are always receiving a favor.
## Ch 3. Commitment & Consistency
"It is easier to commit at the beginning than at the end" -Leonardo Da Vinci
### Summary
People crave consistency in situations, behaviors, and decisions. A commitment is tightly related to consistency has it pairs actions & behaviors with a declaration of an outcome.
### Key Points
- Consistency (and to appear so) is a central motivator for human behavior
    - blind consistency
    - mechanical consistency
- We behave in ways that demonstrate commitment to a previous decision
    - good and bad given thoughtfulness of the past decision
- Actions/deeds mean more than words
- Written commitments are more powerful because they can be made public and writing takes more effort than speaking.
- Commitments take on more power when they are active, public, and take effort
- Above active, public and taking effort, the inner responsibility someone feels can outweigh all other factors for commitment.
- "Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of a lessor mind."
- Counter manipulation with the consistency rule by calling it out to those that are doing it.
## Ch. 4: Social Proof
"Where we all think alike, no thinks very much"
### Key Points
- Discover what other people think is correct to help align with their expectations
- Behavior is "more correct" to the degree others are displaying the same behavior in a given situation
- Connection to commitment and social proof. When too high, it can lead to manipulative, negative outcomes
- During times of low confidence, ambiguity and uncertainty, we are more likely to think the actions of others are correct
- Dispel uncertainty in others by providing direct and individual communication
- Social Proof operates most effectively when there is similarity between people with uncertainty
- Train yourself to be sensitive to situations where auto-responses to social proof are operating with inaccurate information
- Pluralist ignorance phenom
## Ch. 5 : Liking
"The main work of a trial attorney is to make a jury like his client"
### Key Points
- People are more likely to like someone they are
    - physically attracted to,
    - similar to themselves,
    - provide compliments
    - stay in contact and find opportunities to cooperate
    - someone they are conditioned to like (the person who gives you money)
    - someone associated with other things you like (good weather from a meteorologist)
- The counter the manipulation, train yourself to consciously focus on the merit of the deal rather than liking someone.
## Ch. 6 : Authority
"Follow an Expert" -Virgil
### Key Points
- There exists an extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any length based on the command of an authority figure
- Obedience training is an example of using the authority tool to instill compliance
- We are vulnerable to the symbol or connotation of authority as much as the substance / content of what's being shared.
- **Titles**: are the most difficult and the easiest symbols of authority to acquire. Can be highly manipulated by con-artists and "fake it until you make it" behavior.
- **Clothes** can trigger compliance with the authority principles (suit, long white jacket)
- **Trappings** can enhance clothing further (E5 vs 4-star General identification)
- To combat, take a guarded approach to situations with an authority-influence attempt
## Ch. 7 : Scarcity
"The way to love anything is to realize it might be lost"
### Key Points
- We have a pull toward things if have limited opportunities to experience or collect it,.
- The "deadline tactic" can be used a a swindle or a scam
- Attempt to exploit scarcity principle are frequent, wide-ranging, systematic, and diverse because it works.
- Parents who enforce discipline inconsistently produce rebellious children
- To combat, train yourself to be mindful when your brain reacts to scarcity for something you want
